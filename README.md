### BACKGROUND: 

The following .ipynb file is a theoretical project to identify communities from the MovieLens database (~38,000 movies) via two graph algorithms: 

- Label Propagation (Community Detection Algorithm)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (Similarity Algorithm) 

Theoretically, a similar implementation could be used used by movie or streaming service (Netflix) executives to shortlist movies to fund for the future based on the success of historical productions.

The code and subsequent findings progress in 3x phases:

1. Model the Movie graph with the COMMUNITY DETECTION algorithm to find subcommunities.

2. Model the Movie graph with the SIMILARITY algorithm.

3. Select the top five movies from each algorithm, remove duplicates, and then gather a list of Directors and Actors to contact for availability.
