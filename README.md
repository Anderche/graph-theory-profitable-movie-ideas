### BACKGROUND: 

The following .ipynb file is a theoretical project to identify communities from the MovieLens database (~38,000 movies) via two graph algorithms: 

- Label Propagation (Community Detection Algorithm)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (Similarity Algorithm) 


Theoretically, a similar implementation could be used used by movie or streaming service (Netflix) executives to shortlist movies to fund for the future based on the success of historical productions.
